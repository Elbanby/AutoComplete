# Auto Complete React Component
## About
This is an a generic auto complete React component. All you need to do is pass your array of searchable items as an `items` props
`<AutoComplete items={arrayOfSearchableItems}/>`

Also please note that this component has no styling at all, as I am aware that you will need to do custom styling to it.

This is based on this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnpISZANByg&t=34s. However, my component is slightly different than his, and as aforementioned no styling.

Please feel free to recommend a better way of searching to optimize this component.
